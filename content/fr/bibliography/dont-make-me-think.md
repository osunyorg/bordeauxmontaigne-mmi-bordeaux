      Don’t make me think
cover: dont-make-me-think.jpg
author: Steve Krug
summary: Since it was first published in 2000, hundreds of thousands of Web designers
  and developers have relied on usability guru Steve Krug's guide to understand the
  principles of intuitive navigation and information design. Witty, commonsensical,
  and eminently practical, it's one of the best loved and most recommended books on
  the subject. It's a core foundational book that every Web designer must internalize
  to make their designs truly effective. In this substantially revised edition, Steve
  returns with fresh perspective to reconsider the principles he originally laid out--commenting,
  amending, amplifying, and offering fresh new examples to underscore their importance.
  This edition adds an important new chapter on mobile as well as integrating coverage
  of mobile throughout. It's a complete re-imagining of the concepts that made this
  book an instant classic.
