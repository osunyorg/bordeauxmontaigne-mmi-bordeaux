      Weaving the Web
author: Tim Berners-Lee
cover: weaving-the-web.jpg
summary: Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has been hailed by Time
  magazine as one of the 100 greatest minds of this century. This book is written
  to address the questions most people ask - From "What were you thinking when you
  invented it?" through "So what do you think of it now?" to "Where is this all going
  to take us?", this is the story. It is not a technical book. (If you want the technical
  details, check out the W3C web site!). It does mention a little about how technologies
  you may have heard of - like XML - fit in to the past, present and future, but only
  in the course of charting the course for the Web from the initial dream - still
  largely unfulfilled - to the next technical and social revolution.
